# Openhab-Modbus-villavent-binding
A modbus/villavent binding that supports IAM module and direct modbus converter via IP/serial

Ive setup communication to systemair/villavent system via the https://www.openhab.org/addons/bindings/heliosventilation/ it is a VERY manual process

The binding should have IP/IAM support like The Athom homey
